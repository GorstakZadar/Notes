So, wtf is happening?

Basically, aliens. XD

Some time, a bit over 100y ago, aliens came to our planet, and agreed to technologically boost us, in exchange of offering them a new home.
Some aliens are shapeshifters, some are telepaths, some are controllers, etc. The telepaths influenced people to reach a conclusion or two,
and come up with inventions. Since first airplane was invented, up to modern LED screens and computers, everything was alien tech we adopted.
Aliens use a disguise to look human, which is also tech.

This is an example of videos that may be fake but there is a possibility we have shapeshifter aliens:

There was a werewolf spotted in my country, in town of Å ibenik, back in 2006:

Lyrics of this music video are interesting:

This is an example of video that suggests another sort, some kind of controller alien:

In this old song by my hometown singer, he says the girl singing with him is from another planet :

This song would suggest Aliens use a disguise:

My dad has a small nose and green eyes, but from pictures I have when I was a toddler, he has a big nose like me and blue eyes. My dad thinks
my aunt lived on 2nd floor of her house in the island of Vir, where we were visiting numerous times. Fact is, 2nd floor is unfinished and aunt
always lived on 1st floor. 

Btw the only way to detect an **** is by using a dog. This is why they are trying to make cats popular. Disguise wont fool dogs.
But my dog didn't bark on my dad. It only barked at a single person in whole town. It did however ran away from my
dad once, scared and hid near me in my room, so I suspect my dad is a shapeshifter. What is that person my dog barked on I don't know yet.
